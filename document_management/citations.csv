Classic kaposi sarcoma: A comprehensive case report on multisite involvements and therapeutic strategies. Cureus. https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.52553","Classic Kaposi Sarcoma (CKS) is a rare type of cancer, less common than other varieties of Kaposi Sarcoma (KS). This study examines an 83-year-old man with CKS who had lesions on his foot, arm, and thigh, highlighting the difficulties in detecting and treating CKS in various body locations. Kaposi Sarcoma is more typically associated with those with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Classic Kaposi Sarcoma, on the other hand, is more likely to affect people with normal immune systems."

While previous reports showed positive outcomes in eight CKS patients, the study reports a case where 0.5% topical timolol failed to treat the condition over 12 weeks. This suggests that while topical timolol may be a potentially effective and safe alternative for CKS, further prospective studies are needed to understand its overall efficacy and safety."
