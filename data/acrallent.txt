Abstract Background: Acral lentiginous melanoma is associated with worse survival than other subtypes of melanoma. Understanding prognostic factors for survival and recurrence can help better inform follow-up care. Objectives: To analyze the clinicopathologic features, melanoma-speciﬁc survival, and recurrence-free survival by substage in a large, multi-institutional cohort of primary acral lentiginous melanoma patients. Methods: Retrospective review of the United States Melanoma Consortium database, a multi-center prospectively collected database of acral lentiginous melanoma patients treated between January 2000 and December 2017. Results: Of the 433 primary acral lentiginous melanoma patients identiﬁed (median [range] age: 66 [8–97] years; 53% female, 83% white), 66% presented with stage 0–2 disease and the median time of follow-up for the 392 patients included in the survival analysis was 32.5 months (range: 0–259). The 5-year melanoma-speciﬁc survivals by stage were 0 = 100%, I = 93.8%, II = 76.2%, III = 63.4%, IIIA = 80.8%, and IV = 0%. Thicker Breslow depth ((HR) = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.05–1.21; P < .001)) and positive nodal status ((HR) = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.00–3.22; P = .050)) were independent prognostic factors for melanoma-speciﬁc survival. Breslow depth ((HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.07–1.20; P < .001), and positive nodal status (HR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.38–3.80; P = .001) were also prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients, acral lentiginous melanoma was associated with poor outcomes even in early stage disease, consistent with prior reports. Stage IIB and IIC disease were associated with particularly low melanoma-speciﬁc and recurrence-free survival. This suggests that studies investigating adjuvant therapies in stage II patients may be especially valuable in acral lentiginous melanoma patients. The prognosis of patients with ALM is worse compared to patients with non-acral melanoma.1 It has been suggested that decreased survival may be due to a delay in diagnosis, leading to increased tumor thickness and advanced stage at presentation.1,3-12 The later stage at diagnosis may be due to initial misdiagnosis, atypical location compared to super.ﬁcial spreading melanoma, unusual presentation, or delay in seeking care.1,3 However, recent studies have suggested that ALM patients may not necessarily present at a later stage than non-ALM patients.13 Additional possibilities for sur.vival disparities include genomic differences between ALM (likely non-ultraviolet (UV)-induced) and cutaneous mel.anoma (UV-induced).14 The exact cause of the poor prog.nosis associated with ALM therefore remains unknown. A thorough description of the diagnostic, management, and recurrence patterns may uncover key features that help explain the poor survival associated with ALM. Unfortu.nately, many previous studies examining ALM prognosis have been limited by small sample sizes and/or ethnically homogenous populations (i.e., exclusively in Japanese or Caucasian patients) in single-institution cohorts,3,7-12 and the few larger cohort studies have not examined recurrence patterns.1,5,6 In this study, we used a large, multi-institutional melanoma database to not only characterize the presenting clinicopathologic features and recurrence patterns of ALM, but also analyze melanoma-speciﬁc survival (MSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by pathologic American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC) eighth ed. stage and substage, which highlights important prognostic features when caring for patients with ALM. Methods The United States Melanoma Consortium database, a pro.spectively collected database from six institutions (New York University Langone Health, Mofﬁtt Cancer Center, Emory University, Oregon Health and Science University, University of Alabama Birmingham, and Duke University), was used to perform a retrospective study of 433 patients with primary ALM managed surgically at one of the above institutions between January 2000 and December 2017. Patients who presented with recurrent ALM were excluded. All institutions received approval for this study and waiver of consent from their respective institutional review boards (Emory IRB#00101435) Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, clinical characteristics, diagnostic work-up, histopathology of ﬁnal excision specimen, postoperative outcomes, systemic treatment/radiotherapy, disease recurrence and survival data. All tumors underwent wide local excision with margins based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.15 Pathologic TNM stage was used to reclassify patients based on AJCC eighth edition staging.16 Survival time was calculated as months between date of surgery and date of last follow-up or death. Follow-up included clinical exams with the surgeon, oncologist, and/or dermatologist and surveillance imaging at the discretion of the treating physi.cian. Forty-one patients with inadequate details on pathologic stage or date of surgery were excluded from survival analyses. Of the patients included, substage could not be determined for two of the stage II patients. Clinical characteristics analyzed included age, sex, patient-reported race, and location of lesion. Race was included to determine whether or not it is a prognostic factor for survival. Histopathologic characteristics analyzed included AJCC eighth edition stage, Breslow thickness of ﬁnal specimen, presence of ulceration, presence of mitoses, and lymph node status. Five-year MSS and RFS rates and curves were gen.erated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Melanoma-related deaths were determined based on review of death certiﬁcates, inquiry to patient’s treating physicians, known stage IV disease resulting in multisystem organ failure, or documen.tation of hospice care for advanced melanoma. Recurrence was deﬁned as detection of disease in patients whom had no residual disease following intervention. For stage III disease, patients who had undergone completion lymph node dis.section (CLND) were considered to be without residual disease; those who had not undergone CLND were assumed to have no residual disease after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) unless otherwise documented, as data shows that only 11.5% of these patients have residual disease.17 Stage IV patients were excluded from RFS analysis. Univariate Cox regression model was used to determine if any of the clini.copathologic characteristics were associated with MSS or RFS. Proportional hazards assumption was tested using Kaplan–Meier curves and time-dependent covariate Cox re.gression models Characteristics signiﬁcant (P value <.05) on univariate analysis were included in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to identify prognostic factors. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (IBM Inc. Armonk, NY). Clinicopathologic Characteristics aUlceration status was not required to stage 30 patients; substage could not be determined for two patients; ulceration status from biopsy was used to stage the remaining ten patients. The median time to follow up for the 392 patients included was 32 months (range 0–259) Overall 5-year MSS was 78.1% (Figure 1) and by stage were stage 0 = 100%, stage I = 93.8%, IA = 94.2%, IB = 93.4%, II = 76.2%, IIA = 96.8%, IIB = 73.2%, IIC = 63.2%, III = 63.4%, IIIA = 80.8%, IIIB = 79.5%, IIIC = 56.5%, IIID = 44.4%, and IV = 0% (Table 2). The percent of melanoma-related deaths that occurred within 3 years after surgery were 9.1% for stage IIB, 40% for IIC, 25% for IIIA, 66.7% for IIIB, and 89.5% for IIIC. All but 2 stage IIB and IIC patients had sentinel lymph node biopsies performed. Recurrence-Free Survival by Stage Eight additional patients were excluded due to unknown date of recurrence (n = 1) or because they had residual disease following intervention(n= 7).Overall 5-year RFS rate for the 384 included patients was 62.8% (Figure 1)with a median time to recurrence of 23 months (range: 0– 54 months). For patients with recurrence who experienced death, median time to recurrence was 15 months (range: 0– 71 months) and median time between detection of recur.rence and death was 16 months (range: 1–142 months). The 5-year RFS was stage 0 = 100%, stage I = 90.3%, IA = 90.7%, IB = 89.7%, II = 50.1%, IIA = 67.8%, IIB = 45.0%, IIC = 38.3%, III = 38.2%, IIIA = 55.7%, IIIB = 50.2%, IIIC = 33.4%, IIID = .0% (Table 2). The most common ﬁrst site of recurrence was in transit/ satellite (n = 40; 38.8%), which had a median time to re.currence of 21.5 months. Twenty-nine (28.2%) were ﬁrst detected in regional nodes, 25 (24.2%) in distant sites, and 9 (8.7%) in nodal and distant sites with median times to recurrence of 23, 24, and 19 months, respectively.

Of the 11 patients who initially had a positive SLNB, four had undergone a completion lymph node dissection at time of initial treatment. The most common sites of ﬁrst recurrence by substage are summarized in Table 3. Greater than 70% of recurrences occurred within 3 years for stage IIB and higher patients. The percent of recurrences that occurred within 5 years were 94.7% for stage IIB, 100% for IIC, 83.3% for IIIA, 88.9% for IIIB, and 97.1% for stage IIIC. Thirteen stage IIB and IIC patients had nodal recur.renceonlywithmediantimetorecurrenceof13[6–71] months. Following recurrence, 11/13 (84.6%) underwent lymph node excision, 9 (69.2) received systemic therapy (interferon, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy), and 4 (30.8) received radiotherapy. Cox Proportional Hazards Survival Analysis On univariate analysis, the presence of ulceration, presence of mitoses, positive nodal status, advanced pathologic stage, and thicker Breslow depth were associated with reduced MSS and RFS (all P < .05) (Table 4). Age, gender, location of lesion, and race were not signiﬁcantly associated with MSS or RFS. On multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling, thicker Breslow depth ((Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.13 [95% Conﬁdence Interval (CI) = 1.05–1.21]); P = <.001)) and positive nodal status (HR = 1.79 [1.00–3.22]; P = .05), were identiﬁed as independent prognostic factors for reduced MSS (Table 5). Positive nodal status (HR = 2.12 [1.38–3.80]; P = .001), and thicker Breslow depth (HR = 1.13 [1.07–1.20]; P < .001) also remained as independent prognostic factors for RFS. Stage was not included in the multivariate model as it would have confounded with ulceration and Breslow thickness.
